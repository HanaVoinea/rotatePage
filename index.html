	<p>If you are a frontend developer which often gets frustrated and stuck because the backend is not ready then I have great news for you. You can use Firebase as a fully-featured backend and continue your development.
If you don’t know, Firebase is a suite of free Cloud service provided by Google which can be used as a feature-rich back-end to your React or Angular applications. You can use Firebase to store and retrieve real-time data to and from a NoSQL database called Firestore, as well as to authenticate your app’s users with the Firebase Auth service.
You can also use Firebase Storage to upload images as well as deploying all of our applications to Firebase hosting. In short, you can use Firebase as a backend for your application even if the real backend is not ready. <br>
<br>
While Firebase is around for quite some time, it really got traction in the last couple of years after the popularity of Google Cloud Platform increased, and several other Firebase services were introduced.
If you are a front-end developer and creating a frontend using React.js, Angular, Vue.js, or any other front-end development framework, you will benefit from Firebase. <br>
Firebase is equally useful for Mobile developers as well as people using Swift, iOS, and Android to create mobile apps. They can also use Firebase services to create the backend for their application as it provides an online, free database and several other useful services like FireStore, FireAuth, and Firebase Cloud function.<br><br>
More often than not Frontend developers stuck if there is no API to consume, they need an API to download data, authenticate the user and make payments and if that’s not available then they don’t make progress.<br>

While many companies have both frontend and backend developers which work in tandem but for POC and demo, you feel stuck when there is no backend developer and you don’t know how to set up the backend. Firebase solves that problem by providing you a database and pre-built APIs, and Authentication and Payment support.

<p>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services</p>
